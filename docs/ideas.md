# Ideas Parking Lot

This file exists to prevent scope creep.
All ideas go here instead of into the current build.

## Future Ideas
- Calendar sync (Google / Apple)
- Burnout or stress detection
- Semester-level planning
- Mobile app
- AI chat assistant
- Command palette (⌘K)
- Historical performance insights
- Peer comparison (optional / anonymized)
- Export plans to calendar
- Study session recommendations

Nothing in this file is part of V1 unless explicitly moved to the roadmap.
