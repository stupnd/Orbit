# Roadmap

## V1 — Core OS (Now)
Meaningful, usable, demo-able.

### Features
- Course and deliverables input
- Grade projection (current + final estimate)
- Overload detection (simple heuristic-based)
- What-if decision simulator:
  - skipping or reducing effort
  - grade impact
  - time saved
  - risk change
- Glassy, minimal dashboard UI
- Mock data where needed

### Non-goals (explicitly excluded)
- Calendar sync
- Notifications
- Mobile app
- AI chat interface
- User accounts

If it does not directly improve academic decision-making, it does not belong in V1.

---

## V2 — Adaptive Intelligence (Next)
- Learn from user behavior over time
- Better workload prediction
- Smarter effort estimates
- Personalized risk scoring
- Improved AI explanations

---

## V3 — Platform Expansion (Later)
- Calendar integration
- Cross-semester planning
- Burnout detection
- Mobile support
- External integrations
